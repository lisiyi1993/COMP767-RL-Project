# Comparison of Environment Model Augmented Agents with Strong Model-Free Agents
This is the Github repository for COMP767 final prject with team member being Si Yi Li and Zhi Wen.


## This project consists of the following parts.

#### [[minipacman.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/minipacman.ipynb)
This is the notebook for showing how does the Minipacman environment work.


#### [[actor_critic.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/actor_critic.ipynb)
This is the notebook for demonstrating the A2C implementation, training and evaluation. 
The [[actor_critic.py]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/utils/actor_critic.py) 
is the script that we used for A2C training.


#### [[environment_model.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/environment_model.ipynb)
This is the notebook for demonstrating the environmental model implementation, training and evaluation. 
The [[environment_model.py]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/utils/environment_model.py) 
is the script that we used for the environmental training.


#### [[imagination_augmented_agents.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/imagination_augmented_agents.ipynb)
This is the notebook for demonstrating the I2A implementation, training and evaluation. 
The [[imagination_augmented_agent.py]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/utils/imagination_augmented_agent.py) 
is the script that we used for the I2A training.


#### [[dqn.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/dqn.ipynb)
This is the notebook for demonstrating the DQN implementation, training and evaluation. 
The [[dqn.py]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/utils/dqn.py) 
is the script that we used for the DQN training.


#### [[results.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/results.ipynb)
This is the notebook for running all the evaluation.


#### [[animations.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/animations.ipynb)
This is the notebook for generating all the animations. Before running this notebook, 
please create the following folders animations/env_model_png, animations/a2c_png, animations/i2a_r1_png and animations/i2a_r5_png.

#### [[state_space_model.ipynb]](https://github.com/lisiyi1993/COMP767-RL-Project/blob/master/state_space_model.ipynb)[in progress]
This is the notebook for demonstrating the SSM implementation.
